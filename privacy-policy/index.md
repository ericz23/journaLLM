# Privacy Policy

## Overview  
This application is a personal project created and used solely by me. It is not intended for public use, commercial distribution, or access by other individuals. The purpose of this application is to analyze and visualize my own WHOOP data for personal insights.

## Data Collected  
This application may access the following data from my WHOOP account, depending on the scopes granted:
- Activity and workout information  
- Sleep and recovery metrics  
- Physiological and performance metrics  

Only data authorized through WHOOP’s official API is accessed.

## How Data Is Used  
Data is used exclusively for personal analysis, insights, visualization, and experimentation. No personal information or WHOOP data is shared, published, or transmitted to any third party. Data is not used for advertising, profiling of others, or commercial purposes.

## Data Storage  
Data may be temporarily stored locally on my personal computer or within local storage associated with the development and testing of this application. No cloud storage, remote servers, or external databases are used unless explicitly configured and controlled by me.

## Third-Party Sharing  
No personal data or WHOOP data is shared with third parties. No data is sold or disclosed to external organizations, services, or individuals.

## Security  
Reasonable efforts are made to keep data secure on my personal devices. However, since this is a personal project, security practices are informal and designed around single-user use. No guarantees can be made regarding unauthorized access in cases such as device loss or compromise.

## User Accounts and Authentication  
This application uses WHOOP’s OAuth mechanism only for authenticated access to my own account. No other users are able to sign in or connect accounts. No additional user accounts are created within this application.

## Changes to This Policy  
This privacy policy may be updated at any time if project scope changes or the application is made available to additional users.

## Contact  
Because this application is used solely by me, I am the only point of contact regarding privacy or data use questions.
